One of it is the StackOverflow question which is not what I want. All I want is to replace/manipulate the content as displayed inside the blank slate instead of customizing it in per-page basis: Remove the “Create new” link.\n<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/waiyanyoon.com/blank_slate_before.png\" alt=\"Before monkey patching\"></p>\n<p>There’s a question that was asked in Google Groups but it’s been few years but yet received any response, so I decided to create a monkey patch by overriding Active Admin source code. The code is placed in the /config/initializer folder of my Rails project as <code>blank_slate.rb</code> so that the project loads up the patch file without any configuration to load up a lib folder.</p>\n\n<p>By patching the <code>render_blank_slate</code> function and removing the join between the blank slate message and the “Create One” link as returned in <code>blank_slate_link</code>.\n<img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/waiyanyoon.com/blank_slate_after.png\" alt=\"After monkey patching\"></p>",
