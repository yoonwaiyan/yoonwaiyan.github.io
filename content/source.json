Context\\nRails 5.2 has been released not long ago with dozens of new features introduced, among the highlighted ones are ActiveStorage and new encrypted credentials. ActiveStorage might not been used for every developers, but encrypted credentials has changed how secret keys work in Rails applications and it'll affect the deployment process.\\n\\nLet's see what's the key difference of the credentials management between Rails 5.2 and previous versions:\\n\\n### Before\\n- Use of `secret_key_base` in `config/secrets.yml`\\n- Every credentials have to be configured in environment variables to keep the credentials secure.\\n- The environment variables are all being called in `config/secrets.yml`\\n\\n### After\\n- The credentials are **encrypted in local** with the use of `config/master.key`. `config/master.key` is not commited to repo and it's ignored in git by default.\\n- The encrypted credentials commited to repo is `config/credentials.yml.enc`\\n- To configure the credentials, use `$ rails credentials:edit` or `$ EDITOR=vim rails credentials:edit` if `EDITOR` is not configured.\\n\\n## Problem\\nProblem comes in when `config/master.key` is not commited in the repo. When `config/master.key` is not found in the production server, the Rails app in the server couldn't decrypt the credentials thus the credentials couldn't be used. \\n\\nWe failed to deploy to production due to this error:\\n\\n```bash\\nArgumentError: Missing `secret_key_base` for 'production' environment, set this string with `rails credentials:edit`\\n```\\n\\n## Solution\\nThere are two ways to put the master key to production server:\\n1. Use of environment keys (`ENV[RAILS_MASTER_KEY]`)\\n2. Copy `config/master.key` to your server manually without commiting to git\\n\\nSolution #1 didn't work out well for capistrano in our case, thus we have used solution #2 for this app. Copying the file to production server that's being managed by capistrano means I have to configure something so that I don't copy the same key to server everytime we deploy the application. These are the steps to deploy the application successfully for the first time:\\n\\n1. Copy `config/master.key` in your local to the production server under `<project_root>/shared/config/master.key`. If you don't have the key, please get it from your colleagues or whoever that initialized the Rails app.\\n2. Configure your capistrano's `config/deploy.rb` to include this line:\\n    ```ruby\\n      set :linked_files, %w{config/master.key}\\n    ```\\n    By doing this you're telling Capistrano to symlink `config/master.key` to `<project_root>/shared/config/master.key` which contains the master key you've just copied to the server.\\n3. Deploy your app again and verify that deployment is successful.\\n4. Commit this changes to your repo. Don't check-in your `config/master.key`!\\n\\nSide note: In context of using capistrano for deployment, #3 and #4 is interchangable, whichever more comfortable to you. Typically #4 followed by #3 is more comfortable and safer but running #3 first means you'll have more room for try-and-error instead of doing multiple commits due to the script being used for deployment is the local script.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nThis might seem complicated at first glance, but thinking of how the credentials are being managed locally without exposing it in your git repo, the way of copying master key to production and sharing master key to your colleagues seems to be easier compared to setting up environment variables remotely and informing the tech team when there's any change on the credentials.

Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, `like this`. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:\\n\\n```\\n.my-link {\\n    text-decoration: underline;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIf you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using [Prism.js](http://prismjs.com/).\\n\\n\\n## Full bleed images\\n\\nOne neat trick which you can use in Markdown to distinguish between different types of images is to add a `#hash` value to the end of the source URL, and then target images containing the hash with special styling. For example:\\n\\n![walking](https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/walking.jpg#full)\\n\\nwhich is styled with...\\n\\n```\\nimg[src$=\\\"#full\\\"] {\\n    max-width: 100vw;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis creates full-bleed images in the Casper theme, which stretch beyond their usual boundaries right up to the edge of the window.

You can type the characters out, but you can also use keyboard shortcuts.\\n\\n* `CMD/Ctrl + B` for Bold\\n* `CMD/Ctrl + I` for Italic\\n* `CMD/Ctrl + K` for a Link\\n* `CMD/Ctrl + H` for a Heading (Press multiple times for h2/h3/h4/etc)\\n\\nWith just a couple of extra characters here and there, you're well on your way to creating a beautifully formatted story.\\n\\n\\n## Inserting images\\n\\nImages in Markdown look just the same as links, except they're prefixed with an exclamation mark, like this:\\n\\n`![Image description](/path/to/image.jpg)`\\n\\n![Computer](https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/computer.jpg)\\n\\nMost Markdown editors don't make you type this out, though. In Ghost you can click on the image icon in the toolbar at the bottom of the editor, or you can just click and drag an image from your desktop directly into the editor. Both will upload the image for you and generate the appropriate Markdown.\\n\\n_**Important Note:** Ghost does not currently have automatic image resizing, so it's always a good idea to make sure your images aren't gigantic files **before** uploading them to Ghost._\\n\\n\\n## Making lists\\n\\nLists in HTML are a formatting nightmare, but in Markdown they become an absolute breeze with just a couple of characters and a bit of smart automation. For numbered lists, just write out the numbers. For bullet lists, just use `*` or `-` or `+`. Like this:\\n\\n1. Crack the eggs over a bowl\\n2. Whisk them together\\n3. Make an omelette\\n\\nor\\n\\n- Remember to buy milk\\n- Feed the cat\\n- Come up with idea for next story\\n\\n\\n## Adding quotes\\n\\nWhen you want to pull out a particularly good excerpt in the middle of a piece, you can use `>` at the beginning of a paragraph to turn it into a Blockquote. You might've seen this formatting before in email clients.\\n\\n> A well placed quote guides a reader through a story, helping them to understand the most important points being made\\n\\nAll themes handles blockquotes slightly differently. Sometimes they'll look better kept shorter, while other times you can quote fairly hefty amounts of text and get away with it. Generally, the safest option is to use blockquotes sparingly.\\n\\n\\n## Dividing things up\\n\\nIf you're writing a piece in parts and you just feel like you need to divide a couple of sections distinctly from each other, a horizontal rule might be just what you need. Dropping `---` on a new line will create a sleek divider, anywhere you want it.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis should get you going with the vast majority of what you need to do in the editor, but if you're still curious about more advanced tips then check out the [Advanced Markdown Guide](/advanced-markdown/) - or if you'd rather learn about how Ghost taxononomies work, we've got a overview of [how to use Ghost tags](/using-tags/).\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<p>Ghost uses a language called <strong>Markdown</strong> to format text.</p>\n<p>When you go to edit a post and see special characters and colours intertwined between the words, those are Markdown shortcuts which tell Ghost what to do with the words in your document.

For frontend project using React on Ruby on Rails, things are moving fast enough that [react-rails](https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails) is no longer needed and [webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker) is officially introduced to use ES6 and npm libraries for the frontend pages, all this within a year. A [react-data-grid](https://github.com/adazzle/react-data-grid) npm library was found and jquery is no more needed to make things work in jquery [bootstrap-table](https://github.com/wenzhixin/bootstrap-table) is no longer needed in a React ecosystem.\\n\\nOther than that, this project was using a fork of a Rails assets gem which contains the minified library of `react-bootstrap` npm library, which was removed from Github, and the [original repo](https://github.com/mariopeixoto/react-bootstrap-rails) remains unmantained. \\n\\n## Problem\\nWe were forced to use the original repo of the gem but unfortunately there are `inputRef` errors in React Bootstrap which was hard to trace down. I asked the fork owner to recall what was changed to make it work, but we couldn't trace down what was changed in the fork. \\n\\n## Solution\\nOne great hint to the solution of the problem is that the project works on production, so I guess the repo is somewhere inside our production server.

This is how we normally handle the results returned from API in Ruby:\\n```ruby\\nresult = [{\\\"is_sale_prop\\\"=>0, \\\"name\\\"=>\\\"name\\\", \\\"input_type\\\"=>\\\"text\\\", \\\"options\\\"=>[], \\\"is_mandatory\\\"=>1, \\\"attribute_type\\\"=>\\\"normal\\\", \\\"label\\\"=>\\\"Name\\\"},\\n {\\\"is_sale_prop\\\"=>0, \\\"name\\\"=>\\\"short_description\\\", \\\"input_type\\\"=>\\\"richText\\\", \\\"options\\\"=>[], \\\"is_mandatory\\\"=>1, \\\"attribute_type\\\"=>\\\"normal\\\", \\\"label\\\"=>\\\"Highlights\\\"},\\n {\\\"is_sale_prop\\\"=>0, \\\"name\\\"=>\\\"description\\\", \\\"input_type\\\"=>\\\"richText\\\", \\\"options\\\"=>[], \\\"is_mandatory\\\"=>0, \\\"attribute_type\\\"=>\\\"normal\\\", \\\"label\\\"=>\\\"Product Description\\\"},\\n {\\\"is_sale_prop\\\"=>0, \\\"name\\\"=>\\\"video\\\", \\\"input_type\\\"=>\\\"text\\\", \\\"options\\\"=>[], \\\"is_mandatory\\\"=>0, \\\"attribute_type\\\"=>\\\"normal\\\", \\\"label\\\"=>\\\"Video URL\\\"},\\n {\\\"is_sale_prop\\\"=>0, \\\"name\\\"=>\\\"brand\\\", \\\"input_type\\\"=>\\\"singleSelect\\\", \\\"options\\\"=>[], \\\"is_mandatory\\\"=>1, \\\"attribute_type\\\"=>\\\"normal\\\", \\\"label\\\"=>\\\"Brand\\\"},\\n {\\\"is_sale_prop\\\"=>0, \\\"name\\\"=>\\\"model\\\", \\\"input_type\\\"=>\\\"text\\\", \\\"options\\\"=>[], \\\"is_mandatory\\\"=>1, \\\"attribute_type\\\"=>\\\"normal\\\", \\\"label\\\"=>\\\"Model\\\"}]\\n```\\n\\nTake a look at the first element in the array:\\n```ruby\\n> a_hash = result.first\\n# => {\\\"is_sale_prop\\\"=>0, \\\"name\\\"=>\\\"name\\\", \\\"input_type\\\"=>\\\"text\\\", \\\"options\\\"=>[], \\\"is_mandatory\\\"=>1, \\\"attribute_type\\\"=>\\\"normal\\\", \\\"label\\\"=>\\\"Name\\\"}\\n```\\n\\nIn this way the value `input_type` can be obtained by the hash key:\\n```ruby\\n> a_hash[\\\"input_type\\\"]\\n# => \\\"text\\\"\\n```\\n\\nThis is acceptable in cases where the hash is not frequently being accessed. But in cases of heavy usage especially when processing multiple API results, you can make your code better or tidier by converting the API result from hash to an object:\\n```ruby\\n> category_attributes = JSON.parse(result.to_json, object_class: OpenStruct)\\n=> [#<OpenStruct is_sale_prop=0, name=\\\"name\\\", input_type=\\\"text\\\", options=[], is_mandatory=1, attribute_type=\\\"normal\\\", label=\\\"Name\\\">,\\n #<OpenStruct is_sale_prop=0, name=\\\"short_description\\\", input_type=\\\"richText\\\", options=[], is_mandatory=1, attribute_type=\\\"normal\\\", label=\\\"Highlights\\\">,\\n #<OpenStruct is_sale_prop=0, name=\\\"description\\\", input_type=\\\"richText\\\", options=[], is_mandatory=0, attribute_type=\\\"normal\\\", label=\\\"Product Description\\\">,\\n #<OpenStruct is_sale_prop=0, name=\\\"video\\\", input_type=\\\"text\\\", options=[], is_mandatory=0, attribute_type=\\\"normal\\\", label=\\\"Video URL\\\">,\\n #<OpenStruct is_sale_prop=0, name=\\\"brand\\\", input_type=\\\"singleSelect\\\", options=[], is_mandatory=1, attribute_type=\\\"normal\\\", label=\\\"Brand\\\">,\\n #<OpenStruct is_sale_prop=0, name=\\\"model\\\", input_type=\\\"text\\\", options=[], is_mandatory=1, attribute_type=\\\"normal\\\", label=\\\"Model\\\">]\\n```\\n\\nNow we can access the attribute directly:\\n\\n```ruby\\n# get the value via object attribute\\n> category_attributes.first.input_type\\n=> \\\"text\\\"\\n\\n# you can treat it as a hash too\\n> category_attributes.first[\\\"input_type\\\"]\\n=> \\\"text\\\"\\n```\\n\\nSometimes you have API result which is returned as camel case, but snake case is the de facto standard in Ruby. The example below shows the that camel case is being used in some keys e.g. `Status`, `SellerSku` and `ShopSku`.\\n```ruby\\nresponse = {\\\"code\\\"=>\\\"0\\\",\\n \\\"data\\\"=>\\n

hash keys to remain as camelcase, but if you want to convert the keys to snake case instead, Rails provides a helper to transform your hash keys to underscore:\\n```ruby\\n>

The example below shows the that camel case is\nbeing used in some keys e.g. Status, SellerSku  and ShopSku.\n\nresponse = {\"code\"=>\"0\",\n \"data\"=>\n  {\"total_products\"=>\"10\",\n   \"products\"=>\n    [{\"skus\"=>\n       [{\"Status\"=>\"active\",\n         \"quantity\"=>0,\n         \"product_weight\"=>\"0.03\",\n         \"Image2\"=>\"http://sg-live-01.slatic.net/p/BUYI1-catalog.jpg\",\n         \"SellerSku\"=>\"39817:01:01\",\n         \"ShopSku\"=>\"BU565ELAX8AGSGAMZ-1104491\",\n         \"Url\"=>\"https://alice.lazada.sg/asd-1083832.html\",\n         \"package_width\"=>\"10.00\",\n         \"special_to_time\"=>\"2020-02-0300:00\",\n         \"special_from_time\"=>\"2015-07-3100:00\",\n         \"package_height\"=>\"4.00\",\n         \"special_price\"=>9,\n         \"price\"=>32,\n         \"package_length\"=>\"10.00\",\n         \"package_weight\"=>\"0.04\",\n         \"Available\"=>0,\n         \"special_to_date\"=>\"2020-02-03\"}],\n      \"primary_category\"=>\"10000211\",\n      \"attributes\"=>{\"short_description\"=>\"Short Description\", \"name\"=>\"asd\", \"description\"=>\"Description\", \"warranty_type\"=>\"International Manufacturer\", \"brand\"=>\"Asante\"}},\n     {\"skus\"=>\n       [{\"Status\"=>\"active\",\n         \"quantity\"=>0,\n         \"product_weight\"=>\"0.03\",\n         \"Image2\"=>\"http://sg-live-01.slatic.net/p/BUYI1-catalog.jpg\",\n         \"SellerSku\"=>\"39817:01:01\",\n         \"ShopSku\"=>\"BU565ELAX8AGSGAMZ-1104491\",\n         \"Url\"=>\"https://alice.lazada.sg/asd-1083832.html\",\n         \"package_width\"=>\"10.00\",\n         \"special_to_time\"=>\"2020-02-0300:00\",\n         \"special_from_time\"=>\"2015-07-3100:00\",\n         \"package_height\"=>\"4.00\",\n         \"special_price\"=>9,\n         \"price\"=>32,\n         \"package_length\"=>\"10.00\",\n         \"package_weight\"=>\"0.04\",\n         \"Available\"=>0,\n         \"special_to_date\"=>\"2020-02-03\"}],\n      \"primary_category\"=>\"10000211\",\n      \"attributes\"=>{\"short_description\"=>\"Short description\", \"name\"=>\"asd\", \"description\"=>\"Description\", \"warranty_type\"=>\"International Manufacturer\", \"brand\"=>\"Asante\"}}]},\n \"request_id\"=>\"0ba2887315178178017221014\"}\n\n\nIt's totally fine if you want the hash keys to remain as camelcase, but if you\nwant to convert the keys to snake case instead, Rails provides a helper to\ntransform your hash keys to underscore:\n\n> response.deep_transform_keys { |key| key.to_s.underscore }\n=> {\"code\"=>\"0\",\n \"data\"=>\n  {\"total_products\"=>\"10\",\n   \"products\"=>\n    [{\"skus\"=>\n       [{\"status\"=>\"active\",\n         \"quantity\"=>0,\n         \"product_weight\"=>\"0.03\",\n         \"image2\"=>\"http://sg-live-01.slatic.net/p/BUYI1-catalog.jpg\",\n         \"seller_sku\"=>\"39817:01:01\",\n         \"shop_sku\"=>\"BU565ELAX8AGSGAMZ-1104491\",\n         \"url\"=>\"https://alice.lazada.sg/asd-1083832.html\",\n         \"package_width\"=>\"10.00\",\n         \"special_to_time\"=>\"2020-02-0300:00\",\n         \"special_from_time\"=>\"2015-07-3100:00\",\n         \"package_height\"=>\"4.00\",\n         \"special_price\"=>9,\n         \"price\"=>32,\n         \"package_length\"=>\"10.00\",\n         \"package_weight\"=>\"0.04\",\n         \"available\"=>0,\n         \"special_to_date\"=>\"2020-02-03\"}],\n      \"primary_category\"=>\"10000211\",\n      \"attributes\"=>{\"short_description\"=>\"Short Description\", \"name\"=>\"asd\", \"description\"=>\"Description\", \"warranty_type\"=>\"International Manufacturer\", \"brand\"=>\"Asante\"}},\n     {\"skus\"=>\n       [{\"status\"=>\"active\",\n         \"quantity\"=>0,\n         \"product_weight\"=>\"0.03\",\n         \"image2\"=>\"http://sg-live-01.slatic.net/p/BUYI1-catalog.jpg\",\n         \"seller_sku\"=>\"39817:01:01\",\n         \"shop_sku\"=>\"BU565ELAX8AGSGAMZ-1104491\",\n         \"url\"=>\"https://alice.lazada.sg/asd-1083832.html\",\n         \"package_width\"=>\"10.00\",\n         \"special_to_time\"=>\"2020-02-0300:00\",\n         \"special_from_time\"=>\"2015-07-3100:00\",\n         \"package_height\"=>\"4.00\",\n         \"special_price\"=>9,\n         \"price\"=>32,\n         \"package_length\"=>\"10.00\",\n         \"package_weight\"=>\"0.04\",\n         \"available\"=>0,\n         \"special_to_date\"=>\"2020-02-03\"}],\n      \"primary_category\"=>\"10000211\",\n      \"attributes\"=>{\"short_description\"=>\"Short description\", \"name\"=>\"asd\", \"description\"=>\"Description\", \"warranty_type\"=>\"International Manufacturer\", \"brand\"=>\"Asante\"}}]},\n \"request_id\"=>\"0ba2887315178178017221014\"}\n\n\nThese snippets comes in handy while dealing with external APIs which the\nresponse returned is not under control. While using hash or keys with camel case\nwon't cause any problem, but it might somehow hurt the readability of the code\nwhen hash is frequently being used while processing the response, which happened\nin one of our project. Converting the hash to object is recommended unless\nmemory and performance tweaking is in priority.\n\nExternal reading\n 1. https://coderwall.com/p/74rajw/convert-a-complex-nested-hash-to-an-object\n 2. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8706930/converting-nested-hash-keys-from-camelcase-to-snake-case-in-ruby/40093995?noredirect=1#comment72573345_40093995","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2018-05-02T13:35:26.000Z","updated_at":"2018-05-02T14:45:34.000Z","published_at":"2018-05-02T14:40:20.000Z","custom_excerpt":"This post shows how API result returned in hash in Ruby is better when it's converted to objects, and formatting camel case hash keys to use snake case using a Rails helper method to make it more Ruby-ish.","codeinjection_head":"","codeinjection_foot":"","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5b040fcbbd54885f920892a4","uuid":"208587a6-9ffc-4c31-a5da-e3cc7337dafe","title":"A Custom React Component","slug":"converting-react-server-side-pages-to-client-side","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"## Context\\nWe have\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","html":"<h2 id=\"context\">Context</h2>\n<p>We have</p>\n","comment_id":"5b040fcbbd54885f920892a4","plaintext":"Context\nWe have","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"draft","locale":null,"visibility":"public","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":"1","created_at":"2018-05-22T12:40:43.000Z","updated_at":"2018-05-22T12:42:39.000Z","published_at":null,"custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":"","codeinjection_foot":"","og_image":null,"og_title":null,"og_description":null,"twitter_image":null,"twitter_title":null,"twitter_description":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5b1a743fbd54885f920892ab","uuid":"a041e3fb-f428-402b-8537-37d36417b9b5","title":"Understanding Basics of React Context","slug":"understanding-basics-of-react-context","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"markups\":[],\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"card-markdown\",{\"cardName\":\"card-markdown\",\"markdown\":\"The use of React Context with renderProps that's introduced since React v16.3 is highly being recommended in React community to pass global level variables to child components, especially when the passing of the props from parent component to deep levels of child components, for example:\\n\\nThe code snippet before using React Context:\\n```javascript\\nimport React from 'react';\\n// ...\\n\\nconst LoggedInUser = ({ user: { name } }) => (\\n  <Fragment>\\n    <span>Logged in as {name}</span>\\n  </Fragment>\\n);\\n\\nconst Navbar = ({ menu, user }) => (\\n  <div>\\n    <NavigationMenu menus={menu} />\\n    <LoggedInUser user={user} />\\n  </div>\\n);\\n\\nclass Dashboard extends PureComponent {\\n  render() {\\n    const menu = [\\n      { name: 'Home', url: '/' },\\n      { name: 'Preferences', url: '/preferences' }\\n    ];\\n\\n    // user is available at higher level of component\\n    const { user, posts } = this.props;\\n\\n    return (\\n      <Fragment>\\n        <Navbar menu={menu} user={user} />\\n        {posts.map(post => <BlogPost post={post} />)}\\n      </Fragment>\\n    );\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nclass App extends Component {\\n  state = {\\n    user: {}\\n  };\\n\\n  componentDidMount() {\\n    fetchUser().then(user => {\\n      this.setState({ user });\\n    });\\n  }\\n\\n  render() {\\n    const { user } = this.state;\\n\\n    return (\\n      <div>\\n        <Route url=\\\"/\\\" render={() => <Dashboard user={user} />} />\\n      </div>\\n    );\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\nYou'll notice the use of `user` is delegated from `Dashboard` component down to `LoggedInUser` without being used by the components along the delegation.

It\nincreases complexity when the prop is delegated in a handful of levels down\nespecially when there are multiple props being passed down, which is the case of\nthe React codebase of my company project.\n\nNow we're going to replace the props delegation with React.Context. We first\ncreate an Auth React Context:\n\nimport React, { createContext } from 'react';\n\nconst AuthContext = createContext({ isLoggedIn: false, user: {} });\n\nexport default AuthContext;\n\n\ncreateContext()  will create two sub-components: Provider  and Consumer. \nConsumer  provides render props of an object that contains isLoggedIn  and user \nproperties. Now we 'll consume the user object in Navbar  and remove the props\nfrom Dashboard:\n\nimport React from 'react';\nimport AuthContext from './AuthContext';\n\n// ...\n\n// use AuthContext.Consumer to obtain user object\nconst Navbar = ({ menu, user }) => (\n  <div>\n    <NavigationMenu menus={menu} />\n    <AuthContext.Consumer>\n      {({ isAuth, user }) => <LoggedInUser user={user} />}\n    </AuthContext.Consumer>\n  </div>\n);\n\nclass Dashboard extends Component {\n  render() {\n    const menu = [\n      { name: 'Home', url: '/' },\n      { name: 'Preferences', url: '/preferences' }\n    ];\n\n    const { posts } = this.props;\n\n    // now we removed user from the list of props\n    return (\n      <Fragment>\n        <Navbar menu={menu} />\n        {posts.map(post => <BlogPost post={post} />)}\n      </Fragment>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n// ...\n\n\nBy using AuthContext.Consumer, we're able to access the user  object directly\nwithout passing it from Dashboard  component, but when we try to log user to the\nconsole, it appears that user is an empty object. This is because the default\nvalue provided by AuthContext  is an empty user. Now we'll set the value of user\nusing AuthContext.Provider:\n\n// ...\n\nclass App extends Component {\n  state = {\n    user: {},\n    isLoggedIn: false\n  };\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    fetchUser().then(user => {\n      this.setState({ user, isLoggedIn: true });\n    });\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    const { user } = this.state;\n\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <AuthContext.Provider value={{ user, isLoggedIn }}>\n          <Route url=\"/\" component={Dashboard} />\n        </AuthContext.Provider>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n// ...\n\n\nNow we have the user information available in the Consumer!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReact Context is especially useful for:\n\n 1. User authentication and routes management\n 2. Locale and translations management\n 3. Theme or display settings\n 4. Modal management\n 5. State management (instead of Redux)\n\nThe use of each example above is available in the external links provided below.\nCurrently React Context is only used for ActionCable web socket configuration in\nour project as we've just upgraded the React version to version 16.3.2.

By default\ngriddler gem handles the incoming emails in /email_processor  route, so your\nsetup should include a setting to route your emails through HTTP request to your\nlocal web server, such as \nhttps://test-localtunnel-11.localtunnel.me/email_processor.\n\nNow finally it's time to dive in the code. The code snippets below are based on\nMailgun service that I configured personally, feel free to substitute with other\nadapters available to griddler.\n\nAdd these gems to your Gemfile:\n\ngem 'griddler'\ngem 'griddler-mailgun'\n\n\nAnd configure your griddler to use the adapter of your choice:\n\nGriddler.configure do |config|\n  config.email_service = :mailgun\nend\n\n\nAdd mount_griddler  for the simplest configuration provided by Griddler gem by\ndefault. This handles /email_processor  route that is handled by \nGriddler::EmailsController  controller provided by the gem.\n\nRails.application.routes.draw do\n  # ...\n  mount_griddler\nend\n\n\nAdd new file named app/models/email_processor.rb  with the following code as a\ntemplate. Note that this section is different from other guides as there seems\nto be a new syntax being introduced in the gem, as now an instance of \nEmailProcessor  class will be created before process  instance method is called\n(used to be a class method).\n\nclass EmailProcessor\n  def initialize(email)\n    @email = email\n  end\n\n  def process\n    puts \"received email from #{@email.from}:\"\n    p @email.body\n  end\nend\n\n\nNow you can try send an email to your configured domain and observe your local\nwebserver to make sure everything works fine. Advanced configurations (such as\nhandling the route manually or customize your email processor class) is\navailable at the gem README.\n\nHope this clarifies out the way to receive emails from your Rails app.\n\nExternal Readings:\n\n 1.
