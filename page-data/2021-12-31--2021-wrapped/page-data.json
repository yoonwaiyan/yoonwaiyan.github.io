I have changed two jobs since the last blog post on 2019, and I’m now working in a great company with great people at <a href=\"https://hivekind.com\">Hivekind</a>. As I am approaching 30 years old soon, my mindset about my career has changed tremendously over these couple years. I still love coding, but I am in desperate need of balancing my work life balance, after being aware that I am missing out a lot in my life as I devoured most of my time learning all things tech for the past years.</p>\n<p>It does not mean I have stopped improving my skills. By working on more complicated projects, I have exposed myself to Elixir and also incorporated Kubernetes commands in my daily development workflow as a result of dealing with microservices architecture. My time used to ship a bug/feature is not as fast-paced as startups, but the quality of work that I delivered is much better in exchange. Working with great people is actually fun that I get to discuss with my colleagues about the approaches to solve problems. I’m also feeling lucky to have really nice colleagues all around the organization too ;)</p>\n<p>With the pandemic is still around, the challenges we face in daily lives are no lesser. It feels like I have been through a few realms of life just within a year. The non-dropping infection rate at the start of year, causing another lockdown for a few months, vaccination push, eventually the economy reopening, and now the fears of Omicron spread over the world with record-breaking number of new cases with tons of unknown. The politics is getting so unstable now that there is no certainty about the future. All this adds up to the mental fatigue and overstimulation that affects me personally. Is goal-setting still important? I think being gentle to myself for the time being is more important.</p>\n<p>With 2022 approaching, I do hope that things will be better. I don’t know how long it takes, or will the world ever feel normal once again.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"2021 Wrapped","date":"December 31, 2021","description":"","tags":["blog"]}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2019-05-22---introduction-to-promise/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"JavaScript Promise and Async / Await Part 1: Introduction to Promise"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"1f987687-7c91-530e-9e4c-045fccd17247","previousPostId":"6536f031-49fd-5454-a097-ef3bce9c7762","nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3257411868"]}
