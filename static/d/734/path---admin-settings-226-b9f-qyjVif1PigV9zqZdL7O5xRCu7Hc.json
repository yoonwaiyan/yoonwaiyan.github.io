Contributors can create and edit their own\ndraft posts, but they are unable to edit drafts of others or publish posts.\nContributors are untrusted  users with the most basic access to your\npublication.\n\nAuthors\nAuthors are the 2nd user level in Ghost. Authors can write, edit  and publish\ntheir own posts. Authors are trusted  users. If you don't trust users to be\nallowed to publish their own posts, they should be set as Contributors.\n\nEditors\nEditors are the 3rd user level in Ghost. Editors can do everything that an\nAuthor can do, but they can also edit and publish the posts of others - as well\nas their own. Editors can also invite new Contributors+Authors to the site.\n\nAdministrators\nThe top user level in Ghost is Administrator. Again, administrators can do\neverything that Authors and Editors can do, but they can also edit all site\nsettings and data, not just content. Additionally, administrators have full\naccess to invite, manage or remove any other user of the site.\n\nThe Owner\nThere is only ever one owner of a Ghost site. The owner is a special user which\nhas all the same permissions as an Administrator, but with two exceptions: The\nOwner can never be deleted. And in some circumstances the owner will have access\nto additional special settings if applicable. For example: billing details, if\nusing Ghost(Pro) [https://ghost.org/pricing/].\n\nIt's a good idea to ask all of your users to fill out their user profiles,\nincluding bio and social links. These will populate rich structured data for\nposts and generally create more opportunities for themes to fully populate their\ndesign.Next up: Organising your content [/organising-content/]","html":"<p>There are a couple of things to do next while you're getting set up:</p><h1 id=\"make-your-site-private\">Make your site private</h1><p>If you've got a publication that you don't want the world to see yet because it's not ready to launch, you can hide your Ghost site behind a basic shared pass-phrase.</p><p>You can toggle this preference on at the bottom of Ghost's <a href=\"/ghost/settings/general/\">General Settings</a>:</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://static.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/private.png\" class=\"kg-image\"></figure><p>Ghost will give you a short, randomly generated pass-phrase which you can share with anyone who needs access to the site while you're working on it.
